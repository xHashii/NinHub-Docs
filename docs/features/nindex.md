# Nindex (Shared Intel)

Nindex is a powerful tool for creating shared, organized knowledge bases for your corporation, team, or any group within your Discord server.

## What is it for?
*   Tracking member information (e.g., in-game names, specializations, activity).
*   Compiling intel on rival groups or important game locations.
*   Sharing strategies, guides, or build ideas.
*   Organizing any kind of structured information relevant to your group.

## How it Works
1.  **Creation (Admin Command):** A server administrator uses the `/nindex_create` command in Discord, specifying a name for the Nindex and the Discord roles that grant member (view/add) and leader (manage) access.
2.  **Access via Website:** Users with the designated roles can log into the [NinHub website](https://ninhub.xyz/nindex) to view, add, edit, and organize entries within their Nindex.
3.  **Customizable Entries:** Leaders can define the structure and fields for entries.
