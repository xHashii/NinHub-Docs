# Inviting NinHub Bot & Permissions

To get started with NinHub, you'll first need to invite the bot to your Discord server.

## Invite Link

Use the official invite link below:

**[➡️ Add NinHub to Your Server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1376110250570027038&permissions=275435080784&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fninhub.xyz%2Fcallback&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)** 

## After Inviting

Once the bot is in your server, an administrator can proceed with [Server Configuration](server-config.md) to set up specific channels and roles.
